## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to Super Bowl ads, 2015 Women's World Cup predictions, and regional studies of the US. I was looking through the different types of data available on FiveThirtyEight, and they had really interesting data sets available. I would love to follow the one about women's soccer as a former soccer player, but also regional studies. There was one that caught my eye about regional differences around the U.S. for Thanksgiving, and that sounded really cool. I'm from New Jersey, and I love getting to talk to people from around the country about the differences between things that we each find normal.

migrant_data <- read_csv("data/FOTM2-Table 1.csv")

head(migrant_data)

State your research question.
Formulate a hypothesis related to the research question. This hypothesis should be rooted in some sort of theory. In other words, you need to present a plausible story why the hypothesis might be true. Often, this is in the form of a behaviorial or institutional explanation. As social scientists, we are not interested in idiosyncratic explanations; we want to understand systematic patterns and relationships!
Describe your explanatory variable(s) of interest and how it is measured. Importantly, we need to observe variation in this variable in order to study it!
Describe your outcome variable of interest and how it is measured.
What observed pattern in the data would provide support for your hypothesis? More importantly, what observed pattern would disprove your hypothesis?
